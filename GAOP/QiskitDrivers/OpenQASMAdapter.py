        This method executes a given string of program instrutions to be executed by the backend.
        Tentatively, it outputs a state vector with the corresponding broch complex number representation.
        namely: sqrt(2) <-- 100%, sqrt(2)/2 <--- 50%, etc

        TODOs: put executions on a thread with a timer to terminate them. We need to also decide on
        ways to assign the fitness values if the program never terminates.  
        Outputs: 
            dict1: raw data from the state vector of qiskit
            dict2: the computed probability from the state vector (more useful.)
