# GAOP
A GA based OpenQASM 2.0 quantum program generator

The code here is provided as-is. There are numerous TODOs since the modules are created as part of our research project to experiment with GA program generation.

The main test driver is provided in this package: OpenQASMDriverTest_Main.py
And the increment and decrement problems are defined within the incdeclib module.
